2005-12-07  Iain simpson <iain.simpson@nokia.com>
	* Added MX header validity checking so device will no longer respond
	  to an M-SEARCH request if it is empty or a non-integer.
	  Fix in file cdevice_ssdp_server.c

2005-12-02  Aapo Makela <aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Added CG_HTTP_USE_PERSISTENT_CONNECTIONS define to have 
	  persistent HTTP-connections support with libcurl (if server 
	  supports it).
	* Fixed MAN header set bug in Control Point (double quotes for 
	  discover)

2005-12-02  Heikki Junnila <ext-heikki.junnila@nokia.com>
	* Fixed a typo in curl.h and curi.h that was looking for a member
	  declared in "urip" from struct CgNetURL, while it should be "uri"

2005-12-01  Aapo Makela <aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Added show timings statistics also to libcurl routine
	* Fixed to have Multicast TTL as specified in UPnP DA 1.0.1
	  specification (Multicast TTL 4).
	* Added CG_NET_USE_ANYADDR to use INADDR_ANY as network 
	  interface instead of using one socket for each interface 
	  excplicitly.

2005-11-25  Heikki Junnila <ext-heikki.junnila@nokia.com>
        * Removed argumentInList and argumentOutList from caction.[h|c]
          because they were not used anywhere thus hogging unnecessary
          memory.

2005-11-22  Heikki Junnila <ext-heikki.junnila@nokia.com>
	* Changed XML_LIBS and XML_CFLAGS in configure.in to use
	  'pkg-config libxml-2.0' instead of xml2-config. This requires
	  (at least in maemo) that PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
	  points to a directory containing the "pkgconfig" directory.
	  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib should work in most cases.

2005-11-18  Heikki Junnila <ext-heikki.junnila@nokia.com>
	* Fixed an indefinite freezing problem with curl_easy_perform 
          (which can be caused by, for example, an unreachable proxy server
	  set to the environment variable http_proxy)

2005-11-18  Satoshi Konno <skonno@cybergarage.org>
	* Added some logging functions such as cg_debug_setoutputtype() and cg_debug_message().

2005-11-18  Aapo M‰kelÅE<aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Fixed many variable names (dev => childDev) in 
	  cg_upnp_device_* functions.
	* Changed libxml2 parser to unescape XML default entities
	* Fixed to compile without optimized CP mode.

2005-11-16  Aapo M‰kelÅE<aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Modified posix threads to be JOINABLE instead of DETATCHED in 
	  order to make threading more robust. Replaced detatch (in 
	  thread stopping) with join.
	* Changed libxml2 parser to use SAX implementation instead of DOM
	  (approx. 50-100% speed increase)

2005-11-15  Aapo M‰kelÅE<aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Added eventlistener_list, which enables to have multiple event 
	  listeners registered for a control point.
	* Added optional "optimized-cp-mode", in which service 
	  descriptions are loaded only when they are required.
	* Added locking to service parsing process.
	* Some minor fixes to configuration files and macro naming

2005-11-11  Satoshi Konno <skonno@cybergarage.org>
	* Added cg_longlong2str() and cg_str2longlong().
	* Added cg_http_packet_setheaderlonglong() and cg_http_packet_getheaderlonglong().
	* Extended cg_http_packet_setcontentlength() and cg_http_packet_getcontentlength() to 64bit
	  when the compiler is supported C99 or the platform is WIN32.

2005-11-10  Aapo M‰kelÅE<aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Fixed cg_upnp_device_getdevicebyname() not to loop forever
	* Changed cg_upnp_controlpoint_createdevicefromssdppacket to use cg_upnp_controlpoint_getdevicebyname() again

2005-11-09  Aapo M‰kelÅE<aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Fix to use both path and query parts of URI in HTTP request URI
	* Added fixing of broken event and control URLs
	* Changed cg_upnp_controlpoint_createdevicefromssdppacket to not to call cg_upnp_getdevicebyname (which jams to infinite loop sometimes)

2005-11-03  Heikki Junnila <ext-heikki.junnila@nokia.com>
	* Updated configure and make scripts to use libcurl

2005-10-31  Heikki Junnila for Aapo M‰kelÅE Visa Smolander and Iain Simpson
	* Removed all automatically generated files (Makefile.in, config/*, autom4te.cache/*, configure, etc...)
	* Changed "<" to "<=" in cg_upnp_control_isqueryrequest()
	* cg_http_packet_sethost(): "port" was an excess parameter for s(n)printf when port <= 0. Removed the parameter.
	* cg_net_getmodifierhosturl set the tag begin mark "<" before port while it must come before "http://"
	* cg_socket_getrawtype and cg_socket_getprototype: changed sock->type to socket->type to use the macro parameter correctly.

	* cg_upnp_action_post: If action post was unsuccessful, put the error message to the action response
	* cg_upnp_control_action_request_createactionnode: Don't include output args in request
	* cg_upnp_event_subscription_request_setservice: changed eventSubURLStr[1] to [0]
	* PosixThreadProc: Added a signal handler to block all signals to posix threads
	* cg_net_uri_set: Accepts URI (as a path), which doesn't have a slash.
	* cg_upnp_device_byebyefrom & _announcefrom: Added missing advertisement and byebye messages
	* cg_upnp_ssdpresponse_setext and cg_upnp_ssdpresponse_setserver added to cssdp.h
	* Added comments to some headers (cdevice.h and util/*)
	* Added performance measurement functionality for XML parsers under SHOW_TIMINGS macro (not enabled by default)
	* cg_upnp_device_ssdpmessagereceived: Corrected response to MSearch message for all ST (search target) types.
	* upnpdump.c: Added some M-SEARCH sending actions
	* clock_device.c: Removed :schemas: from clock service description
	* Added libtool support to configure.in
	* Added debian package creation support to configure.in and Makefile.am
	* cg_upnp_ssdpresponse_serverlist_open returns FALSE immediately if port opening fails
	* Fixed a memory leak problem in the http client thread.

2005-10-13  Satoshi Konno <skonno@cybergarage.org>

	* v1.1
