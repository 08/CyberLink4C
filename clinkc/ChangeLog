	  order to make threading more robust. Replaced detatch (in 
	  thread stopping) with join.
	* Changed libxml2 parser to use SAX implementation instead of DOM
	  (approx. 50-100% speed increase)

2005-11-15  Aapo Mäkelä <aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Added eventlistener_list, which enables to have multiple event 
	  listeners registered for a control point.
	* Added optional "optimized-cp-mode", in which service 
	  descriptions are loaded only when they are required.
	* Added locking to service parsing process.
	* Some minor fixes to configuration files and macro naming

2005-11-11  Satoshi Konno <skonno@cybergarage.org>
	* Added cg_longlong2str() and cg_str2longlong().
	* Added cg_http_packet_setheaderlonglong() and cg_http_packet_getheaderlonglong().
	* Extended cg_http_packet_setcontentlength() and cg_http_packet_getcontentlength() to 64bit
	  when the compiler is supported C99 or the platform is WIN32.

2005-11-10  Aapo Mäkelä <aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Fixed cg_upnp_device_getdevicebyname() not to loop forever
	* Changed cg_upnp_controlpoint_createdevicefromssdppacket to use cg_upnp_controlpoint_getdevicebyname() again

2005-11-09  Aapo Mäkelä <aapo.makela@nokia.com>
	* Fix to use both path and query parts of URI in HTTP request URI
	* Added fixing of broken event and control URLs
	* Changed cg_upnp_controlpoint_createdevicefromssdppacket to not to call cg_upnp_getdevicebyname (which jams to infinite loop sometimes)

2005-11-03  Heikki Junnila <ext-heikki.junnila@nokia.com>
	* Updated configure and make scripts to use libcurl

2005-10-31  Heikki Junnila for Aapo Mäkelä, Visa Smolander and Iain Simpson
	* Removed all automatically generated files (Makefile.in, config/*, autom4te.cache/*, configure, etc...)
	* Changed "<" to "<=" in cg_upnp_control_isqueryrequest()
	* cg_http_packet_sethost(): "port" was an excess parameter for s(n)printf when port <= 0. Removed the parameter.
	* cg_net_getmodifierhosturl set the tag begin mark "<" before port while it must come before "http://"
	* cg_socket_getrawtype and cg_socket_getprototype: changed sock->type to socket->type to use the macro parameter correctly.

	* cg_upnp_control_action_request_createactionnode: Don't include output args in request
	* cg_upnp_event_subscription_request_setservice: changed eventSubURLStr[1] to [0]
	* PosixThreadProc: Added a signal handler to block all signals to posix threads
	* cg_net_uri_set: Accepts URI (as a path), which doesn't have a slash.
	* cg_upnp_device_byebyefrom & _announcefrom: Added missing advertisement and byebye messages
	* cg_upnp_ssdpresponse_setext and cg_upnp_ssdpresponse_setserver added to cssdp.h
	* Added comments to some headers (cdevice.h and util/*)
	* Added performance measurement functionality for XML parsers under SHOW_TIMINGS macro (not enabled by default)
	* cg_upnp_device_ssdpmessagereceived: Corrected response to MSearch message for all ST (search target) types.
	* upnpdump.c: Added some M-SEARCH sending actions
	* clock_device.c: Removed :schemas: from clock service description
